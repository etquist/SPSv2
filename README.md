1. Drag and Drop / general editing ability for the grid structure in an interactive window: 
(  1a  ) Custom QLabel implementation which will hold the component information (instances from the catalogue), and provide the relevant information to the interactive window
(  1b  ) Custom window implementaiton which allows for specific clicking and drag/drop behaviors
2. Back end development for data storage and handling, and microgrid solving:
(  2a  ) Database selection and development (TOAD) and defining connections between the local memory and device storage
(  2b  ) Debugging tree view widget which sometimes overwrites the widget header with a newly created node's information
3. General UI improvements:
(  3a  ) Editing window for component attributes
 
# Known List of To-Do Items:
